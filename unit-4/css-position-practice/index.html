</div>

<div class="fixed">
    <b>A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place EVEN if the page is scrolled. As with relative, the top, right, bottom, and left properties are used. </b>


    <h1>fixed</h1>


    A <b>fixed</b> element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place EVEN if the page is scrolled. As with relative, the top, right, bottom, and left properties are used.

</div>

<h2>position: absolute;</h2>

<p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>

<div class="relative">
    This div element has position: relative;

    <div class="absolute">
        This div element has position: absolute;
    </div>
</div>
